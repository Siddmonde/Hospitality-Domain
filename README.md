# Business Terminology:
In the hotel industry, several key metrics are crucial for assessing performance and making informed decisions. Here's a brief explanation of some of these metrics:

ADR (Average Daily Rate): ADR represents the average price charged for each room per day. It's calculated by dividing total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.

Average Rating: This is an average score or rating given by guests based on their stay experience, often derived from guest reviews and surveys.

DBRN (Daily Booked Room Night): This metric tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period.

DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Night): This metric tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

DURN (Daily Utilized Room Night): This metric tells on average how many rooms are successfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period.

Occupancy (%): Occupancy percentage calculates the ratio of occupied rooms to total available rooms, a key performance indicator.

No Show Rate (%): This metric reveals the percentage of guests who make reservations but fail to arrive at the hotel as scheduled.

Realisation (%): It is nothing but the successful "checked out" percentage of all bookings that happened.

Revenue: Total revenue generated by the hotel, encompassing income from various sources like room bookings, dining services, and events.


# Insights:
ADR Remains Stable:

Upon analyzing the dashboard, it's evident that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for AtliQ Hotels has remained relatively stable over the given time frame. This stability in pricing indicates a consistent pricing strategy.

Notably, AtliQ Hotels currently do not employ dynamic pricing based on weekdays and weekends. This presents an opportunity to consider adjusting the pricing strategy. Dynamic pricing can help optimize revenue by offering different rates for weekdays and weekends, aligning pricing more closely with demand fluctuations.

This insight suggests that exploring dynamic pricing strategies could be a valuable initiative to consider, potentially leading to increased revenue and better revenue management.

Overall Occupancy Rate:

The overall occupancy rate for AtliQ Grands' properties currently stands at a solid 57%. This figure reflects the percentage of available rooms that are being utilized by guests. A 57% occupancy rate indicates a substantial portion of rooms are booked, contributing positively to revenue.

Maintaining a healthy occupancy rate is crucial for optimizing revenue and resource management. This insight suggests that AtliQ Grands has been successful in attracting guests and efficiently filling available rooms.

As part of ongoing strategies, it may be worthwhile to explore avenues to further increase occupancy, especially during off-peak periods, to maximize revenue potential.

Overall, the 57% occupancy rate provides a foundational understanding of AtliQ Grands' performance and can serve as a basis for further revenue optimization efforts.

Average Rating:

The average guest rating for AtliQ Grands' properties is a commendable 3.62. This rating, derived from guest reviews and surveys, reflects the overall satisfaction of guests who have experienced our hospitality.

A rating of 3.62 signifies a positive guest experience, with the majority of guests expressing satisfaction with their stays. Guest ratings are a vital indicator of our service quality and the guest experience we provide.

As we continue to prioritize guest satisfaction, it's important to maintain and improve upon this rating. By consistently delivering exceptional service, addressing guest feedback, and enhancing guest experiences, we can aim for even higher ratings in the future.

The 3.62 average rating underscores our commitment to offering outstanding hospitality and ensuring our guests have memorable stays.

RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): 

RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotel measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.

These metrics play a vital role in hotel management, aiding in pricing optimization, resource allocation, and enhancing overall guest satisfaction. Understanding and monitoring these metrics are essential for a hotel's success.
